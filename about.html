	<h1>About F&S Photography</h1>
	</header>
	
	<p>when we first came to the United States from Peru in 2005, we were fascinated by the world of photography. I first bought a proffesional camera in 2009, and Sonia and I used it to try and capture some of life's beautiful moments. I discovered the passion for great pictures, as well as the challenge of finding the perfect moment to shoot, and that's when we decided to offer our services to others. We have two areas where we do business: Utah, and Hawaii. My sister, Sonia is in Utah, and I live in Hawaii. We love doing new events, and we have a lot of experience with family focused settings, such as weddings, birthdays, pregnancies, and other important life announcements.
